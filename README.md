This case study was completed using nonlinear optimization in SAS. The following questions were addressed in the project files and presentation:


1. Given a portfolio's percentage breakdown allocated across five assets for the period 2000 to 2017:                               
   - What was the average return of the portfolio?
   - What was the average standard deviation of the portfolio?
   - How do the returns and volatility compare with that of the broad market?
   - How much could the standard deviation have been reduced by enforcing a 60% stocks and 40% bonds composition requirement for the portfolio?
   - Using the same set of assets, how much could the standard deviation have been reduced without enforcing the 60/40 constraint?

2. Given a portfolio's percentage breakdown allocated across five assets for the period 2000 to 2017 and a given average annual returns range:
   - What is the efficient frontier for this set of assets?

3. Given another portfolio's percentage breakdown allocated across five assets for the period 2000 to 2017 and a given average annual returns range:
   - What is the efficient frontier for this set of assets?
   - File: Case3Q3.sas
   
4. Given the same portfolio conditions as previous question with T-bills as an additional option and a short position permitted for T-bills only:
   - What effect does the addition of T-bills have on the efficient frontier for this set of assets?
